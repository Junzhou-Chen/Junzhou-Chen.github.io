# Projects


## Research on Medical Image Processing Methods

The project collaborates with a medical image processing company in Nanjing to develop based on mathematical statistics pathological analysis of cervical cell slice images. This project has the potential to significantly improve the early diagnosis rate of cancer in patients while greatly reducing the workload of medical professionals.

In this project, the difficult problem is on cell segmentation in Barr’s cell slice images, with the technical challenge lying in the segmentation of overlapping cells. To address the limitations of traditional network architectures, an innovative HARU-Net network model has been developed, achieving segmentation accuracy at the state-of-the-art (SOTA) level.
