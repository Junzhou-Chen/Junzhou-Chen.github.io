# Reckless Driving Review

### Basic information 

**Driver:** Junzhou Chen

**Time:** 6:12 AM

**Place:** BYPASS RD

**Speed:** 52 / 25

**Vehicle:** Subaru Forester Premium 2025 Gray

### Situation discribe:

I drove to my friend's house at around 6am on the morning of the incident, planning to pick him up at the airport. It was still dark at that time, with little traffic on the road and no obvious street lighting.

The road I was driving on was Bypass Rd, and the speed limit displayed on my navigation device was 45 mph. Due to the dim surrounding environment and my impression of the road section as having a higher speed limit, I set the speed to a cruising speed of about 50 mph. At this time, my focus was mainly on the road conditions and the safety of the surrounding environment. In dark conditions, the speed limit signs on both sides of the road were weakly reflective and not visually recognizable. Later, I discovered that there was a 25 mph speed limit sign on the road section, but it was often only visible when the vehicle was very close, and once it was discovered, it was difficult to reduce to the corresponding speed in time.

According to my careful recollection and review afterwards, there were limited speed limit signs on the roadside at that time, the lighting was insufficient, and I also made mistakes in insufficiently checking the navigation information and the actual road conditions. Although this does not completely absolve me of responsibility, it was an objective reason for my speeding at the time. I did not have any subjective intention to deliberately ignore the speed limit signs and endanger traffic safety.

I have always attached great importance to safe driving and respect the law. I deeply apologize for this incident and am willing to actively cooperate with all investigations and possible penalties. I will also learn from this experience and be more cautious in the future, pay attention to the road surface and surrounding signs, and compare the navigation with the actual road information to ensure that the speed limit regulations are always followed.

I have attached all the on-site photos and details related to this incident to the end of this statement.
